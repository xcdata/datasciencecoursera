## Processing steps in run_analysis.R
The data.table package was used to process the raw data. For those not familar with data.table, the code may look not easy to understand. Please familar yourself with data.table before trying to understand the steps.

- download the original data
- read in the original feature matrix from both train and test
- combine train and test
- read in the original feature names
- annotate the combined feature matrix using the original feature names
- filtering feature matrix: only keep the mean and standard deviation measures
- make the feature names more descriptive
	- replace the "t" prefix with "time"
	- replace the "f" prefix with "frequencyDomain"
	- replace "Acc" with "Acceleration"
	- replace "Gyro" with "Gyroscope"
	- replace "Mag" with "Magnitude"
	- replace "mean()" with "mean"
	- replace "std()" with "standardDeviation"
- read in the original activity labels 
- read in the original activity label to name mapping
- translate the original activity label list into activity name list
- read in the original subject labels
- combine the subject list, activity name list, and filtered feature list into one variable
- generate another tidy data for the average measures for each subject and activity
